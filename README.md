# QBCore Item List Generator

This project is a web-based application designed to simplify the creation and management of item lists for the QBCore framework used in FiveM servers. The application allows users to add items manually via a form or bulk import items using a CSV file. It also supports specific fields for weapon items, such as `ammoType`.

## Features

- **Manual Item Addition:** Add items one by one using an intuitive form.
- **CSV Bulk Import:** Upload a CSV file to quickly import multiple items.
- **Weapon Support:** Specify an `ammoType` for weapon items.
- **Code Generation:** Automatically generates Lua code for QBCore item definitions.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Easily copy the generated code for use in your server.
- **Undo and Clear Options:** Remove the last added item or clear all items with a single click.
